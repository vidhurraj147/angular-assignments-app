############### 
Property Binding 
    We bind to properties using Square Brackets []
    [ngClass] [ngStyle] [disabled]

Event Binding 
    We bind to events using round brackets ( )
    (click) (keyup)

Two-Way Binding
    Can simultaneously bind to a property and event, sending data both ways [( )]
    [(ngModel)] = "<property"


############## Services and Observables Http get methods
Wy we need services 
    Shouldnot handle data in our components
    Coponents should focus on presenting data
    Services should provide the data throughout your app

Service --> GET POST UPDATE DELETE methods should be implemented

Observables 
    An observable lets you subscribe asynchronous data
    Observable lets you manage Asynchronous data 
    Relationship between publisher and subscriber
    Emits multiple values over time
    Has operators as .map()  .filter() and forEach()

Diff between Observables and Promises     
Observables
    A stream of data which is open 
    can be cancelled 
    Provides operators such as MAP and forEach

Promises
    Resolves once data is received 
    Cannot be cancelled 
    NO operators
